# Multiple files

There's multiple files because I'm defining some helper library crates. The main project is called "tetra".

# Launch

Need rust cargo (its package manager). I don't know why yet but executables do not work by themselves currenlty.

Download folder, go in "tetra" and type in terminal :

```bash
cargo run -r
```

(`-r` for "release mode" as opposed to "debug mode" that contains additional checks)
